# ChillRansomware
ChillRansomware is a Ransomware from the Chill Malware bundle

This has currently one flaw, it generates the key client side, so it could technically be reversed on how secure "crypto secure" is in c#, this can be fixed by generating the key in the backend. I won't update this ransomware but I will possibly code another one in go
